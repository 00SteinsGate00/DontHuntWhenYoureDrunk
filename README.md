# Don't Hunt When You're Drunk

A small game made with Unity. I had to do it for a university assignment and it's my first work ever done in Unity.

It's nothing special but it's not boring either I guess.

The code itself could need some improvement, I was just learning more and more about Unity while working on this porject. If I had to start over I'd do things differently.

## Controls

  * Use the mouse to aim
  * **Left Click** Shoot
  * **Right Click** Reload
  * You get a *Combo Multiplyer* if you hit birds in a row without missing
  * Game's over when time's up

## Where's the Drunk Part?

My original idea was, that with every time you reload, you take a sip of Whiskey and the crosshair gets more and more shaky. But the lack of time prevented me from adding that feature.

So right now it`s just **Hunt**.
